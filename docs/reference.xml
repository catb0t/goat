	<s name="Introduction">
		<s name="First">
			<p><b>Goat</b>  is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language, based on JavaScript. It supports the basic functionality of JavaScript, but in addition, it adds support for multithreading, multiple inheritance, operator overloading (all as in C ++), simplified syntax, and so on.</p>
			<p>Why "Goat"? At first I wanted to name this programming language as "Go", but unfortunately, some little-known company (it seems "Google" or something like that) has already developed a programming language with that name. After a while, when I programmed this interpreter on a laptop lying in a hammock, <i>I was <b>suddenly</b> bitten by my goat</i>. I thought that once the name "Go" is occupied, then perhaps the name "Goat" is no worse. I immediately named the project folder this name and since then it has not changed.</p>
