<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>To be done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>In comparison with JavaScript</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Goat programming language based in general on JavaScript, but it has some differences:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Interpreter is very small program and can be compiled and started in different platforms. I tried  Windows and Linux (both x86 and ARM). All you need are C++11 compiler and standart C library (libc etc).</li>
		<li>Programs starts not in browser, not in special environment (Node.js); you can write general-purpose applications. Easy to install: just copy the file with your code and interpreter and then start.</li>
		<li>Syntax is more simple, object model is more unificated.</li>
		<li>Goat language supports multi-threading and operators overloading.</li>
		<li>You can create object from more than one prototype.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some samples are below.</p>
	
	<h3>Primitive types</h3>
	<blockquote>
	<h4>JavaScript</h4>
	<p>A primitive data type is data that is not an object and has no methods. There are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol. All primitives are immutable.</p>
	<h4>Goat</h4>
	<p>There are no primitive types. All data represented as objects. Each object except <code>undefined</code> has some methods. There are some predefined objects which are prototypes for primitive data, such as numbers or strings: Char, String, Integer, <del>Real,</del> Boolean and Null.</p>
	<p>For determine what the type (prototype) of expression, use <code>instanceOf()</code> method:</p>
	<pre>
	print(13.instanceOf(Integer)); // output: true
	</pre>
	
	</blockquote>

	<h3>Inheritance</h3>
	<blockquote>
	<h4>JavaScript</h4>
	<pre>
	var A = function() {
		this.x = 0;
	};

	var B = function() {
		A.apply(this);
		this.y = 1;
	};
	B.prototype = new A();
		
	var C = function() {
		B.apply(this);
		this.z = 2;
	};
	C.prototype = new B();
	</pre>
	<h4>Goat</h4>
	<p>Use operator <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
	<pre>
	var A = {
		x : 0
	};

	var B = A -> {
		y : 1
	};

	var C = B -> {
		z : 2
	};
	</pre>
	</blockquote>
	
	<h3>Multiple inheritance</h3>
	<blockquote>
	<h4>JavaScript</h4>
	<p>Is not supported. You can use some tricks (say mixins) but it is not true multiple inheritance.</p>
	<h4>Goat</h4>
	<p>Why not.</p>
	<pre>
	var A = {
		x : 0
	};

	var B = {
		y : 1
	};

	var C = [A, B] -> {
		z : 2
	};
	</pre>
	<p>The diamond problem: Goat uses the list of prototypes to inherit from as an ordered list. The interpreter uses the first method it finds by depth-first searching.</p>
