		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>To be done.</p>
		
		<h2>In comparison with JavaScript</h2>
		<p>The Goat programming language based in general on JavaScript, but it has some differences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interpreter is very small program and can be compiled and started in different platforms. I tried  Windows and Linux (both x86 and ARM). All you need are C++11 compiler and standart C library (libc etc).</li>
			<li>Programs starts not in browser, not in special environment (Node.js); you can write general-purpose applications. Easy to install: just copy the file with your code and interpreter and then start.</li>
			<li>Syntax is more simple, object model is more unificated.</li>
			<li>Goat language supports multi-threading and operators overloading.</li>
			<li>You can create object from more than one prototype.</li>
		</ul>
