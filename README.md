# Goat
**Goat** is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted general-purpose programming language, based on JavaScript. It supports the basic functionality of JavaScript, but in addition, it adds support for multithreading, multiple inheritance, operator overloading (all as in C ++), simplified syntax, and so on.

The interpreter (engine) of the programming language is completely developed from scratch. The interpreter is the very small program and can be easily compiled and started on different platforms, say Windows and Linux (both x86 and ARM).
